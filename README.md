<h2>Implementation of advanced data structures and algorithms</h2>

<h4>The below are the details of the projects present</h4>

<h3>SP0</h3>
This has three files<br/>
<ul>
<li>	ImplementSorts.java - which implement the merge sort and has a priority sorted(Heap Sort)  implemented.
<li>	MergeSortGeneric.java - The generic version of merge sort Implementation
<li>	MergeSort.java - The merge sort which only supports for integer numbers.
<li>	This project analyzes the running time of merge sort and heap sort.
<li>	Java's System.currentTimeMillis() has been used to analyze the running time.
</ul>

<h3>SP1</h3>
This has three files<br/>
<ul>
<li>	MergeSortNonRecursive.java - The non recursive implementation of merge sort using Stacks and Queues.
<li>	SetOperations.java - The has basic set operations like A-B, A∪B, A∩B with a sample driver program
<li>	SinglyLinkedListReverse.java - The basic implementation of singly linked list (recursive and non recursive)
</ul>

<h3>SP2</h3>
This has five files<br/>
The below are the graph helper classes<br/>
<ul>
<li>	Edge.java  
<li>	Graph.java
<li>	Vertex.java  
<li>	CheckEulerian.java - To find if a given graph is Eulerian or not
<li>	FindOddLengthCycle.java - This class has is to check if there is an odd length cycle in the graph for  bipartite graph and also the code to check if a graph has cycle or not (both prositive and negative)
</ul>

<h3>SP3</h3>
This has four java files<br/>
<ul>
<li>	Fibonacci.java - to find the nth fibonacci number.
<li>	MultiPivotQuickSort.java - This has the multi pivot(two) implementation of quick sort (both random and non random)
<li>	QuickSort.java - This has the single pivot implementation of quick sort (both random and non random)
<li>	QuickSortImplement.java - drive to compare the running time of two versions of quick sort
</ul>

<h3>SP0PQ</h3>
This has eight java files<br/>
      The below are the graph helpers<br/>
<ul>
<li>	Edge.java
<li>	Graph.java
<li>	Vertex.java

</ul>
The below are two priority queues<br/>
<ul>
<li>	Index.java - helper for priority queues (PQ)
<li>	PQ.java - The PQ interface
<li>	BinaryHeap.java - Normal implementation of PQ's using Binary Heap
<li>	IndexedHeap.java - Indexed PQ version
</ul>
The below are the MST's<br/>
<ul>

<li>MST.java - The are two version of MST's here PRIM1 which uses binary heaps and PRIM2 which uses Indexed Heaps.
</ul>

<h3>SP4</h3>
 There are two files<br/>
<ul>
<li>	BST.java - The basic operations in binary trees like insertion, deletion, check the balance condition, check the ordering property, to find the diameter of the BST.
<li>	AVLTree.java - To be modified
</ul>

<h3>LP1</h3>
<ul>
<li>	BigArithmetic.java - This has basic arithmetic operations of big numbers using lists (A+B, A-B, A^b, A*B) for base-10 numbers.
</ul>

<h3>LP2</h3>
<ul>
<li>	This is exactly as same as the project SP0PQ except that the java file MST.java has Kruskal algorithm to find the MST
</ul>

<h3>SP0SL</h3>
<ul>
<li> This project analyze the performance between Java's TreeSet and SkipList
</ul>
