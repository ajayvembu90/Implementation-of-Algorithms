#Implementation of advanced data structures and algorithms

#The below are the details of the projects present

<h3>SP0</h3>
This has three files<br/>
<ul>
<li>	ImplementSorts.java - which implement the merge sort and has a priority sorted(Heap Sort)  implemented.
<li>	MergeSortGeneric.java - The generic version of merge sort Implementation
<li>	MergeSort.java - The merge sort which only supports for integer numbers.
<li>	This project analyzes the running time of merge sort and heap sort.
<li>	Java's System.currentTimeMillis() has been used to analyze the running time.
</ul>

#SP1
This has three files
•	MergeSortNonRecursive.java - The non recursive implementation of merge sort using Stacks and Queues.
•	SetOperations.java - The has basic set operations like A-B, A∪B, A∩B with a sample driver program
•	SinglyLinkedListReverse.java - The basic implementation of singly linked list (recursive and non recursive)

#SP2
This has five files
The below are the graph helper classes
•	Edge.java  
•	Graph.java
•	Vertex.java  
•	CheckEulerian.java - To find if a given graph is Eulerian or not
•	FindOddLengthCycle.java - This class has is to check if there is an odd length cycle in the graph for  bipartite graph and also the code to check if a graph has cycle or not (both prositive and negative)

#SP3
This has four java files
•	Fibonacci.java - to find the nth fibonacci number.
•	MultiPivotQuickSort.java - This has the multi pivot(two) implementation of quick sort (both random and non random)
•	QuickSort.java - This has the single pivot implementation of quick sort (both random and non random)
•	QuickSortImplement.java - drive to compare the running time of two versions of quick sort

#SP0PQ
This has eight java files  
      The below are the graph helpers
•	Edge.java
•	Graph.java
•	Vertex.java
•	The below are two priority queues
•	Index.java - helper for priority queues (PQ)
•	PQ.java - The PQ interface
•	BinaryHeap.java - Normal implementation of PQ's using Binary Heap
•	IndexedHeap.java - Indexed PQ version
•	The below are the MST's
•	MST.java - The are two version of MST's here PRIM1 which uses binary heaps and PRIM2 which uses Indexed Heaps.

#SP4
 There are two files
•	BST.java - The basic operations in binary trees like insertion, deletion, check the balance condition, check the ordering property, to find the diameter of the BST.
•	AVLTree.java - To be modified

#LP1
•	BigArithmetic.java - This has basic arithmetic operations of big numbers using lists (A+B, A-B, A^b, A*B) for base-10 numbers.

#LP2
•	This is exactly as same as the project SP0PQ except that the java file MST.java has Kruskal algorithm to find the MST
